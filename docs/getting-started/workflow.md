# Welcome to Baga Ivy Generator

**Baga Ivy Generator** is a powerful Blender addon dedicated to the generation of ivy, vines, and various climbing or creeping plants. Whether you need a quick background fill or a precise hero asset, this tool provides the flexibility required for high-end environment art.

---

## What is Baga Ivy Generator?

The addon is designed to streamline the creation of organic growth within Blender. It offers a vast library of assets and a highly customizable generation system:

* **Extensive Library**: Includes approximately **70 different species** with more than **300 unique flower and leaf assets**.
* **Versatile Growth**: Create everything from simple ivy to complex climbing vines and creeping plants.
* **Compatibility**: Currently supports **Blender 4.2 and newer**.

## How it Works?

Creating ivy is an intuitive process that integrates directly into your Blender workflow through the **N-Panel**:

1.  **Select Assets**: Choose your plant assets or a predefined preset.
2.  **Pick a Target**: Select the object on which you want the ivy to grow.
3.  **Choose Mode**: Select a generation mode Simulation or Procedural (Fast, Accurate, or Precision) depending on your needs.
4.  **Generate**: Click "Add New Ivy" and adjust parameters to perfectly fit your environment.

# Generation Modes

Baga Ivy Generator V3 features two primary generation methods: **Simulation** and **Procedural**. 

> **Artistic Philosophy**: These ivies are not intended to be biologically accurate. They are simplified imitations of reality designed to prioritize **artistic control** and performance over botanical perfection.

## 1. Simulation Method (V3)
The simulation method allows you to create ivy with a fully animated and adjustable growth process. It is ideal for high-end realism and physics-based interactions.

* **Animated Growth**: Create ivy with a growth process that is entirely animated and adjustable.
* **Surface Morphology**: The ivy follows the target surface's shape precisely.
* **Physics Support**: Branches can naturally detach from the surface and fall due to gravity.
* **Complex Structure**: It generates a branch structure that is visually more accurate than procedural methods.

## 2. Procedural Method
The procedural method generates ivy **instantly**, providing immediate feedback and extensive control over placement and propagation. 

It is divided into three distinct modes, each suited for different use cases:

| Mode | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fast** | Ideal for generating ivy over large areas quickly. |
| **Accurate** | Best for generating ivy on smaller surfaces with more detail. |
| **Precision** | Allows you to draw branches manually for total control in the foreground. |

## Important Notes

!!! info "Which one to choose?"
    * Use **Simulation** when you need physics-based realism, hanging vines, or an animated growth sequence.
    * Use **Procedural** for static environments where speed, instant feedback, and easy propagation control are your top priorities.

!!! warning "Switching Modes"
    While you can switch between Procedural modes (Fast, Accurate, Precision) after generation, switching from a Procedural method to a Simulation method (or vice versa) may require you to re-generate the ivy from scratch.
