## What is Baga Ivy Generator?

This addon streamlines the creation of organic growth through three specialized generation modes and a massive library of assets.

### Key Features

* **Extensive Library:** Includes over **300 assets** and **70 presets** (flowers, leaves, various species) ready to use from the Asset Browser.
* **Animation Ready:** Generates loopable wind animations and dynamic leaf movement out of the box.
* **Optimization:** Built-in proxy system and bounding box generation to keep your viewport smooth, even with heavy vegetation.
