# Installation

This guide will walk you through the steps to install **Baga Ivy Generator** in Blender. The process follows the standard Blender addon installation method.

## 1. Download the Addon
After your purchase, download the `.zip` file corresponding to your Blender version.
The file should be named:  
`Baga_Ivy_Generator_VX.X.X_Blender_XX.zip`

> **⚠️ Important: Do NOT unzip the file!** > Blender installs the addon directly from the compressed ZIP file. If you extract it manually, the installation might fail or cause errors.
