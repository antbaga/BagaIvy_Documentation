## Why is V3 a Paid Upgrade ?

For over three years, every update and improvement to BagaIvy has been included for free. While we have loved providing this value, maintaining a "lifetime free updates" model is unfortunately no longer economically viable for a project of this scale.

**A Sustainable Future for Addon Developpment**

BagaIvy has evolved from a simple geometry nodes setup into one of our largest codebases, requiring hundreds of hours of development, testing, and support.

Much like other major tools in the Blender ecosystem, we are facing a general trend of rising development costs. For the addon to "carry its own weight" and to allow us to dedicate the time necessary to build features like the new **Simulation Mode**, we must transition to a sustainable pricing model.

**What this means for you:**

1.  **Major Updates:** Significant versions (like V3) will now be paid upgrades (with FREE updates for recent orders (<1 year) and 50% discounts for previous users).
2.  **Minor Updates:** Bug fixes and support will remain free for the current version you own.
3.  **No Forced Upgrades:** If you are happy with **BagaIvy V2**, you can keep using it indefinitely. Files remain available.

We believe this change is necessary to guarantee the quality and longevity of future tools. We appreciate your understanding and your continued support.
