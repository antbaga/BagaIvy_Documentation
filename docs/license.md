## 1. Dual-License Structure

Baga Ivy Generator is distributed under a dual-license system to comply with Blender's requirements while protecting the authors' creative work:

* **Software (Code)**: The Python code that utilizes the Blender API is licensed under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**.
* **Creative Content (Assets)**: All non-code elements—including but not limited to 3D models, leaf/flower assets, textures, procedural shaders, Geometry Node groups, icons, and imagery—are licensed under a **Royalty-Free License** as detailed below.

## 2. Permitted Usage

You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Addon and its assets for:

* **Personal and Commercial Productions**: You may use the Addon to create rendered images, animations, and videos for your own projects or for clients.
* **Ownership of Output**: You own the final rendered output (images/videos) created using the Addon. You are free to sell, distribute, or monetize these renders without any further royalties.

---

## 3. Strict Restrictions on Assets

The creative assets included with the Addon are for your use only. **You are strictly prohibited from**:

* **Redistribution**: You may not share, sell, sub-license, or give away the Addon or any of its individual assets (models, textures, node groups) to any third party.
* **Asset Packs**: You may not include the assets or Geometry Node setups in other asset packs, kits, or libraries for sale or free distribution.
* **Reverse Engineering**: You may not extract the node groups or shaders to resell them as standalone products.

## 4. Video Games & Real-Time Applications

The use of Baga Ivy Generator in video games or interactive applications is **permitted** under the following condition:

* **Asset Protection**: The assets must be embedded or "cooked" within the application's proprietary data format (e.g., .pak, .unitypackage). 
* **No Direct Access**: The end-user of your game or application must not have direct access to the original 3D models or textures for use outside of your project. 

As long as the assets are not retrievable as individual files, you are free to use them in your real-time productions.

## 5. Intellectual Property

All rights, titles, and interests in the Addon and its assets remain the exclusive property of **Kiara Bagattini** aka Antoine Bagattini, **BagaCorp**, and **Laura Mercadal**.
