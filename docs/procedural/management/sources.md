# Source Objects

The **Source Objects** panel group the collections and assets used by the ivy generator. This is where you can swap out entire plant species or tweak the orientation of your custom assets.

## Collections

This menu displays the specific collections where your generation data and assets are stored.
You have total flexibility in how you assign assets to your ivy.

* **Switching Collections**: You can select a different collection at any time to replace all flowers or leaves.
* **Single Asset Mode**: Use the **Switch Button** if you prefer to use only one object as asset rather than a collection.

## Rotation Offset

A common issue when using your own custom assets is that they may not be oriented correctly relative to the branches. 

* **Leaf Instance Rotation**: If your leaves or flowers are pointing in the wrong direction, adjust these values to align them with the generator's default orientation.
