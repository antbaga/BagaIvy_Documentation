Selecting the right method depends on whether you need high-end realism and animation or instant results for background scenes. Simulation Method (V3) Best for: Physics-based growth, Hanging vines, and Realistic growth animations. The Simulation method provides a highly realistic behavior where the ivy follows the surface morphology precisely and can even detach or fall under gravity. Unlike the procedural method, Simulation requires a Baking process to generate the final result. The Two-Step Workflow To create a simulated ivy, you must proceed through two consecutive baking stages: Step 1 - Core Growth : This creates the main skeleton of the ivy. It defines the primary path the plant takes across the target surface. Step 2 - Foliage Growth : Once the core is baked, this step generates the volume and smaller branches branching out from the core structure. This two-step approach allows you to first control the global positioning (Step 1) before managing the density and propagation of the foliage (Step 2). Calculation Modes For each step, you can choose between two calculation methods: Immediate : Calculates all growth steps at once based on your current frame (e.g., at frame 60, it calculates 60 steps instantly). Best for: Real-time tweaking of settings. We recommend using this at a low frame (30 or 40) to find the right look. Progressive : Calculates one growth increment (\"step\") per frame as you run the timeline. Best for: Large-scale ivy or final bakes. It is much lighter on performance as it only calculates one step at a time. Pro Tip: Dial in your settings using Immediate mode first, then switch to Progressive and increase the frame range for the final bake. Note on Animation : The timing used during the setup and baking process does not lock your final animation. Once baked, you have full artistic control over the growth speed and timing of the ivy. Procedural Method (V2 & 3) The procedural method generates ivy instantly, providing immediate feedback and extensive control over propagation without the need for baking. 1. Fast Mode Best for: Large areas, Backgrounds, and Performance optimization. The Fast mode is designed to cover massive surfaces quickly. It uses a simplified calculation method to ensure Blender remains responsive even when generating vast amounts of vegetation. Use case : Covering distant castle walls or large environmental spaces. Performance : Extremely high; creates fewer calculations per branch. Limitation : Reduced control over individual branch behavior. 2. Accurate Mode Best for: Medium shots and Realistic surface adaptation. The Accurate mode calculates growth with more finesse. It respects the geometry of your target object more closely, creating realistic branching patterns suitable for most standard uses. Use case : Ivy growing on pillars, window frames, or human-scale props. Performance : Medium; requires more calculation time than Fast mode. 3. Precision Mode Best for: Hero assets and Manual artistic control. Precision mode offers the ultimate control by allowing you to draw branches manually. This is the ideal choice for ivy placed directly in front of the camera. Use case : Specific artistic direction or focal points. Feature : Enables the Draw Tool (automatically switches Blender to Edit Mode). Performance : Variable; depends on the complexity of your manual drawing. Important Notes Changing Modes While you can switch between Procedural modes (Fast, Accurate, Precision) after generating an ivy, be aware that the addon must re-calculate the entire generation. For complex setups, this may cause Blender to freeze temporarily while it processes the new data. Tool Tips If you are unsure about a specific setting, click the i (Info) icon next to the parameter. A window will appear with explanatory text and a link to a video tutorial.","title":"Generation Modes"},{"location":"getting-started/modes/#generation-modes","text":"Baga Ivy Generator V3 offers two distinct generation methods: Simulation and Procedural .

Set the 3D Cursor : Set a \"Start Point\" by positionning the 3D Cursor (ivy will grow from this point). Choose Mode : Select a generation method Simulation or Procedural (Fast, Accurate, or Precision) depending on your needs. Generate : Click \u201cAdd Ivy,\u201d then draw for procedural ivy or bake for simulation. BagaIvy Simulation First Steps Youtube Tutorial Generation Modes Baga Ivy Generator V3 features two primary generation methods: Simulation and Procedural . Artistic Philosophy : These ivies are not intended to be biologically accurate. They are simplified imitations of reality designed to prioritize artistic control and performance over botanical perfection. 1. Simulation Method (V3) The simulation method allows you to create ivy with a fully animated and adjustable growth process. It is ideal for high-end realism and physics-based interactions. Animated Growth : Create ivy with a growth process that is entirely animated and adjustable. Surface Morphology : The ivy follows the target surface's shape precisely. Physics Support : Branches can naturally detach from the surface and fall due to gravity. Complex Structure : It generates a branch structure that is visually more accurate than procedural methods. 2. Procedural Method The procedural method generates ivy instantly , providing immediate feedback and extensive control over placement and propagation. It is divided into three distinct modes, each suited for different use cases: Mode Use Case Fast Ideal for generating ivy over large areas quickly. Accurate Best for generating ivy on smaller surfaces with more detail. Precision Allows you to draw branches manually for total control in the foreground. Important Notes Which one to choose ? Use Simulation when you need physics-based realism, hanging vines, or an animated growth sequence. Use Procedural for static environments where speed, instant feedback, and easy propagation control are your top priorities. Switching Modes While you can switch between Procedural modes (Fast, Accurate, Precision) after generation, switching from a Procedural method to a Simulation method (or vice versa) may require you to remove and re-add the ivy from scratch.","title":"First Steps (Workflow)"},{"location":"getting-started/workflow/#welcome-to-baga-ivy-generator","text":"Baga Ivy Generator is a powerful Blender addon dedicated to the generation of ivy, vines, and various climbing or creeping plants.

This mode only animates the movement of the leaves and flowers (wind effect). Simulation Method : This is the only method that allows for fully animated growth from start to finish. Animation Methods You can choose between two main methods depending on your project needs: 1. Continue Provides a constant, randomized movement. This is perfect for standard scenes where you don't need the animation to loop perfectly. 2. Loop Specifically designed for rendering long sequences or background loops. Loop every X frames : Set the exact duration of the loop. The movement will seamlessly restart at the end of this frame count.

It acts as a collision or exclusion zone, allowing you to precisely control where the plant is allowed to grow\u2014for example, to prevent leaves from penetrating window frames or doors. Available only in Accurate mode. How to use Effectors Setting up an exclusion zone is a simple three-step process: Select the Effector object : In the 3D View, select the mesh you want to use as an obstacle. Select the Ivy : Hold Shift and select the Ivy object. Add : In the Effector panel of the BagaIvy panel, click the + Add button. To stop an object from acting as an effector, simply select the object and the ivy, then click the - Remove button. Effector Parameters Once an object is assigned as an effector, you can fine-tune its influence: Distance : Defines the reach of the exclusion zone around the effector object. Affect Branches : A toggle to choose if the effector should push back the entire plant structure or only the foliage (leaves and flowers). Distance Random : Adds organic variation to the exclusion zone so the ivy doesn't stop in a perfectly straight line. Leaf Offset : Adjusts the specific offset between the foliage and the branches within the effector's range. Pro-Tip: Using Hidden Volumes Instead of using your complex render geometry (like a high-poly window frame) as an effector, it is often more efficient and flexible to: Create a Simple Mesh : Place a simple cube or primitive that covers the area you want to protect. Set as Effector : Assign this simple mesh as the effector for your ivy. Hide for Render : In the Outliner, disable the Camera icon for this mesh so it is hidden during the final render.

Select the Target Select the mesh (or multiple meshes) in your 3D view that the ivy will grow on. These are your Target objects. 2. Configure the Generator In the addon panel, ensure the following are set: Method/Generator : Select Procedural . Generation Mode : Choose between Fast , Accurate , or Precision . You can change this later, but it's more intuitive to pick one now. Select Asset Source : Asset Browser : To use official presets or your own library. View 3D : To use objects already present in your scene. 3. Choose your Species (Presets) Open the Asset Browser , go to the Baga Ivy Generator library, and select a species from the Presets category. Tip : You can also select any object from any of your personal libraries in the Asset Browser to use it as a custom leaf/flowers..Assets with \"flower\" in the name will automatically be assigned in the flower part (Collection) of the ivy. 4. Place the Start Point The ivy needs to know where to begin. Place the 3D Cursor on the surface of your target object ( Shift + Right Click ). The generator will create a Start Point at this exact location. Note: You can move this point or add more later to create multiple growth origins. 5. Generate Click the Add New Ivy button. Your ivy will appear instantly! Important Rules Switching Modes Within Procedural : You can freely switch between Fast , Accurate , and Precision modes at any time after creation. Simulation vs Procedural : You cannot switch a procedural ivy to a simulation ivy (and vice-versa). These methods use different calculation systems. Changing Presets Don't worry if you change your mind! You can change the preset or the assets used even after the ivy has been generated.

The Drawing Workflow When you add a new ivy, BagaIvy automatically switches to Edit Mode . This allows you to draw on your surface and thus define precisely where the ivy will grow. How it works ? Curve-Based System : The ivy's structure is built upon a curve. By drawing or editing this curve, you define the path and repartition of the ivy. Surface Snapping : The ivy is designed to automatically snap to the nearest target surface, but it will always prioritize following the path of the curve you draw. Draw : Simply use the Draw Tool to sketch on your mesh, and the ivy will generate along your brush strokes. Re-entering Draw Mode If you have exited Edit Mode to tweak parameters and want to go back to drawing: Select your Ivy object. At the bottom of the BagaIvy N-Panel , click the Draw Mode button. Alternatively, you can simply press Tab to enter Blender's standard Edit Mode. Pro Tips for Realistic Results Watch your Distance The drawing tool requires a logical path to follow. If you start a new stroke too far from the existing ivy, the generator will not be able to bridge the gap. Always try to start your strokes near an existing branch to ensure a continuous growth. Creating Detail Branches You can add a high level of realism by drawing short strokes near the main ivy structure (without overlapping it). If the stroke is close enough, the generator will treat it as a secondary branch extending from the main vine.

Mode Specificity Parameters in the Growth menu vary significantly depending on whether you are using Fast , Accurate , or Precision mode. Because each mode uses a different generation algorithm, settings are not synchronized when you switch between them. 1. Fast Mode Parameters Best for: Backgrounds and large surfaces. In Fast Mode , the generator creates a small initial \"piece\" of ivy\u2014called an Island \u2014and replicates it across the drawn areas to maximize performance. Main Settings Ivy Density : Controls the global amount of vegetation (Leaves, Flowers and Fruits). Ivy Propagation : Defines how far the ivy spreads from curvz. Angle Target Edge : Adjusts how the ivy embraces the shape of the geometry as it unfurls. Ivy Bridge : Settings to control how ivy spans gaps between different surfaces. Ivy Island (Exclusive to Fast Mode) This sub-menu allows you to modify the individual \"piece\" used for replication: Display Only Ivy Island : Isolate the original island to see exactly what is being instantiated. Branch Detachment : Add or remove assets specifically from the island structure. Wavy Growth : Adds random variation to the scale and shape of the island assets. Branch Radius : Defines the minimum and maximum thickness of the island's branches. 2. Accurate Mode Parameters Best for: Medium to close-up shots requiring realistic branching. This mode generates a true mesh of branches with \"realistic\" ramifications (splitting branches). Ivy Growth : Increases or reduces the length of the individual segments that compose the trunk and branches. Network Density : Regulates the density of the branch network by increasing the probability of branch intersections. Precision : Sets how closely the branches follow the target geometry, especially near the edges. Surface Offset : Creates a slight gap between the wall and the ivy. Warning: If set too high, the ivy may fail to generate. 3. Precision Mode Parameters Best for: Hero assets and foreground elements. In Precision Mode , you draw branch by branch. You have total manual control, but the generator does not produce automatic ramifications (secondary branches). Curve-Based Control : You can manually adjust the Radius (thickness) and Tilt (rotation) of each branch using Blender's curve tools. Branch Profile & Shader : Auto Radius : Automatically merges branches together for a more organic look. UV Scale : Adjusts the scale of the procedural bark texture. Material/Color : Direct access to customize the bark's color, brightness, and material assignment.

Baking converts the procedural physics calculations into a stored data cache, ensuring your ivy stays exactly as you designed it and remains performant during playback. You must save your file before Baking. Bake Packing BagaIvy Simulation is available from Blender 4.2 and newer versions. However, in Blender 4.2 only, there may be issues when removing bake caches. We recommend using the addon in Blender 4.3 or newer, as bake caches are stored directly inside the .blend file in those versions, which reduces potential bugs. The Two-Step Workflow All simulation logic in BagaIvy relies on a two-stage baking process. You must complete Step 1 before you can proceed to Step 2. Step 1 - Core Growth : Creates the main skeleton of the ivy. It defines the primary path and propagation of the plant. Step 2 - Foliage Growth : Generates the volume, smaller branches, and foliage based on the skeleton created in Step 1. Dependencies These steps are linked. You can only bake Step 2 if Step 1 is already baked. If you delete the Step 1 cache, the Step 2 cache will automatically be deleted as well. Calculation Modes Before clicking \"Bake,\" you must choose how the addon calculates the growth : Immediate Mode : Calculates all growth steps instantly up to your current frame (e.g., at frame 60, it calculates 60 steps at once). Best for: Real-time tweaking of settings. Use it at low frames (30-40) to find your look. Progressive Mode : Calculates one growth increment step* per frame as the timeline plays. Best for: Final bakes or very large ivy setups, as it is much lighter on performance. * Step: Here step represents a unit of growth. It is the physical increment of the plant in the simulation. Pro Tip: Dial in your settings in Immediate mode first, then switch to Progressive for the final high-frame-range bake. You can use different modes for Step 1 and Step 2. Progressive and Immediate produce the exact same result. Technical: The Bake Cache BagaIvy stores bake data in external folders. This is why you must save your .blend file before baking . Folder Structure By default, the cache is created in the same directory as your .blend file in a folder named blendcache_[your_file_name] . Inside, you will find: Modifier Subfolders : Folders corresponding to the simulation modifiers. 9-digit Folders : In Modifier Subfolders, each 9-digit folder (e.g. \"314159265\") represents a specific Bake Node. These contain a blob folder (raw data) and a meta folder (JSON identification). Deleting Files If you manually delete these folders from your hard drive, you lose your baked simulation data. Custom Locations & Packaging Click the Package icon (folder icon) to: Pack the bake data directly into the .blend file for easier sharing. Set a Custom Location to save the bake data on a specific drive or server. Optimization Bake Located in the Optimization menu, this third bake button is designed as final step. It can only be used once Step 1 and Step 2 are baked. Still : Freezes the ivy in its current form. The plant will not move. Animation : Calculates and freezes every frame of the viewport animation. Render Note If you bake for optimization while using proxies or hidden elements, the final render will show those simplified versions. Ensure you bake with full detail or delete the optimization bake before rendering. Troubleshooting & Manual Management Resetting a Bake If you want to modify any settings belonging to a stage (e.g., changing Step 1 simulation parameters), you must delete the cache for that step and re-bake. Identifying the Cache Click the \"?\" icon next to the Bake button to reveal the unique 9-digit ID of the current bake. This helps you find the exact folder in your blendcache directory. If you overwrote an existing file with a new bake cache and encounter an issue, deleting the old cache might fix the issue.

Exponential Growth Be careful with high spawn rates and long lifetimes. Because branches spawn new branches which then spawn more, the simulation can quickly become exponential and impact performance. Simulation Settings These parameters define the physical behavior of the ivy during the growth calculation. Lifetime : Defines how long each branch lives (in iterations) before it stops growing or disappears. Growth Step : Sets the speed and distance of growth per iteration. Detach Age : The branch age (in iterations) after which it stops clinging to surfaces and begins to fall due to gravity. Gravity Strength : The strength of the downward force that pulls branches down once they are detached or airborne. Detection Radius : The maximum distance at which a branch can detect and attach to nearby target surfaces. Spawn Rate : Controls how frequently new branches are created per iteration. Max Spawn Age : The maximum branch age where new offshoots can still sprout; beyond this limit, no new branches form from that specific segment. Branch Angle : The angle between the main parent branch and a newly created offshoot. Draw Influence & Deformation Draw Influence : You can use curves to manually guide the path of the ivy. For detailed control, refer to the Draw Control in the Features section. Deformation : Adds organic noise and smoothing to the generated curves to make them look more natural. Post-Bake Restrictions Once the simulation is Baked , the Simulation Settings , Draw Influence and Deformation panels are locked and no longer available.

This allows you to fine-tune the visual mesh without re-simulating. Radius (Start/End) : Sets the thickness of the branches at their origin and tips. Minimum Radius : Ensures branches do not become thinner than this value. Step Reduction : Gradually reduces the radius as the branch grows. Resolution & Segment Length : Controls the density of the mesh topology. Material : Assign your bark or stem material here. UV Scale : Adjusts the tiling of the trunk texture. Remember to use an 'Attribute' node and use 'UVs' aas attribute name in your shader. Fix Sharp Angles If the ivy has sharp edges or hard breaks, go to Geometry (sub-panel).

While procedural ivy is limited to leaf movement, simulation mode enables full growth animation. Growth This section handles the progression of the ivy from birth to full growth. Growth Methods You can choose how the growth is triggered: Scene Time : The growth is synchronized with the baked frame range. Time Scale : Allows you to speed up or slow down the overall growth speed. Time Offset : Shifts the starting frame of the animation. Manual : Replaces timeline synchronization with a simple 0 to 1 slider . 0 represents the very start of the growth. 1 represents the fully grown ivy. This slider is fully animatable via keyframes for precise control. Growth Parameters Time Profile : Used to edit the velocity curve of the growth (e.g., fast at the start, slow at the end, loops, ...). Branch Growth Mode : A factor that balances two growth behaviors: At 0 : All branches continue to grow slowly until the entire baked frame range has passed (older branches slow down as they age). At 1 : Branches grow at a constant speed and finish their growth much earlier than the total animation length. Tip : A value of 0.8 is recommended for the most natural-looking results. Deform Animation : Adds an organic offset/displacement effect to the branches during their growth phase. Wind The Wind panel is used to animate leaf movement. These settings are identical to the Procedural mode. Wind Methods Continue : Provides a constant, randomized wind effect. Loop : Designed for seamless animation loops in long sequences. Parameters Speed & Turbidity : Sets the basic velocity and chaos of the swaying foliage. Vertical & Horizontal Influence : Fine-tune the movement independently for each axis. Intensity : The strength of the wind on that specific axis. Time Offset : Offsets the animation between different leaves so they don't move in perfect unison. Influence Texture : Uses a procedural texture to drive the movement's intensity locally. Fix Leaf Flickering If some leaves flicker (their orientation changes abruptly from one frame to another or they behave erratically), enable the Anti-Flick feature. Go to Leaves & Flowers \u2192 Growth and enable Anti-Flick . Info In most cases, simply enabling this fixes the issue. Note that it slightly reduces leaf orientation accuracy. If flickering persists: Increase Smooth Rotation to a very low value (e.g. 0.01 ). This usually targets only the flickering leaves. They may still move, but the rotation will be distributed across multiple frames. If the issue still persists, increase the value to 0.9 or 0.95 .
